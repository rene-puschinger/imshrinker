# imshrinker
ImShrinker - SPIHT algorithm implementation

**Created by Ren√© Puchinger in 2008 (revised in 2013).**

A minimal implementation (console only) of the SPIHT (Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees) algorithm as presented in the paper
"A new, fast, and efficient image codec based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees" by A. Said and W. A. Pearlman
(IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 6 (1996), pp. 243 - 250).

**The code is intended for educational purposes only.**

Compilation
-----------
To build the application you can use the GNU C++ Compiler:
```
g++ *.cpp -o imshrinker
```

Usage
-----
```
imshrinker [c[bpp]|d] [file_in] [file_out]
```

Where:

 c[bpp] - compress with bit rate bpp (default: bpp = 0.5)

 d      - decompress

Example:
```
imshrinker c0.1 image.ppm image.ims
imshrinker d image.ims image_new.ppm
```

This will compress the file image.ppm with the bitrate of 0.1 bpp and then decompress it back.

The application supports raw grayscale and raw color images (PGM, PPM) as and input file. You can convert any image to the PGM or PPM format in GIMP.

Benchmark
---------
Benchmark is included in the attached article spiht.pdf.
